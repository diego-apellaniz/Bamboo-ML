# Bamboo-ML
 
This repository contains a Python Scrpt that allows the user to optimize Bamboo Structures with Machine learning, in order to use the least amount of bamboo canes to build a certain bamboo structure. Two different bamboo structures are provided as JSON files as case studies:

In order to run the python script, it is strongly recommended to create a virtual python environment with the following python libraries:  
python               3.5  
Keras                2.2.4  
matplotlib           3.1.3  
numpy                1.18.1  
opencv-python        4.2.0.32  
pandas               1.0.1  
scipy                1.4.1  
tensorboard          1.13.1  
tensorflow           1.13.1  
tqdm                 4.43.0  

Special thanks to:  
- Vlad Buzica: for introducing me to this problem and showing me his algorithm to sort bamboo canes
